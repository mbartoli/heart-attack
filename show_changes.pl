show_changes.pl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $ show_changes.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program takes the various I<reports> produced by the scans and
puts them together into one report showing the changes taking place
since the first report.

Reports are hardcoded into the program. (I'm too lazy to setup 
Getopts::Long) so there is nothing to enter. Basically, only the
websites were the first report and last report have differenecs show
up in this report.

You can setup the various files and report headings by modifying the
I<constants> at the top of the program.
